TODO:
- [x] Merge the new funcions of the CellularAutomata
- [x] Decouples the visual component from the real agent
- [ ] Rename the gameServer interface (Change in the Cellular automata too in all lines???)
- [ ] Rename the chatServer interface
- [ ] Refactor the CellularAutomata class
- [x] Remove the plot part
- [ ] Define a class findStrategy to find different strategy based on game and then perfome different actions (Have to think better on how define it)
