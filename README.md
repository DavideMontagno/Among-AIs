# Dependencies

You need python 3.6.12 to use our bot AI.
Next move is to install all the python dependecies with the command:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The file requirements.txt is in the repository

You need java 8+ to use the client application, instead for the web application the firefox browser can cause some problem, so we suggest you to play it with other browsers like Chrome, Safari ecc.
